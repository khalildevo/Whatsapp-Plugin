Make sure you've entered your phone number in the settings. The button won't display until a valid phone number is provided.

Enter your full phone number with country code but without any spaces, dashes, or the + symbol. For example, for a US number: 11234567890

### Can I change the size of the button?

Currently, the button size is fixed for optimal mobile and desktop viewing. You can customize the size through custom CSS if needed.

### Will this work on mobile devices?
